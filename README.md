# 🧬 Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and a variety of machine learning models.

## 📁 Project Structure

- Data Preprocessing & Feature Selection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building with:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC)

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI ML Repository – Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- **Target Variable**: Diagnosis (Benign = 0, Malignant = 1)

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-prediction.git
cd cancer-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook "Cancer Prediction Project.ipynb"
📈 Results
The best model achieved an accuracy of over X% (you can update with your actual result) using Random Forest/SVM.

## 💼 Insurance Charges Prediction Project - `README.md`

```markdown
# 💼 Insurance Charges Prediction Using Regression Models

This project predicts medical insurance costs using demographic and lifestyle attributes. Regression algorithms are used to build predictive models.

## 📁 Project Workflow

1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
5. Evaluation Metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score)

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Likely the [Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
- **Features**: age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region
- **Target**: `charges`

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurance-prediction.git
cd insurance-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook "Insurance_Project.ipynb"
📈 Results
Model performance comparison showed that Random Forest had the best predictive accuracy with an R² score of approximately X.XX (update with your actual result).
